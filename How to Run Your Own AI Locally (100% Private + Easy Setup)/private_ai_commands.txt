# Welcome to your ultimate guide for running a fully private AI on your own computer! 
Whether you’re on Windows or Linux, this guide will walk you step by step through installing, configuring, and running your AI locally — 100% private, with

### For Windows Users

We recommend installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
WSL lets you run a full Linux environment directly on Windows, perfect for AI projects.

Open the Command Prompt (cmd) as an Administrator and run:

    wsl --install

This will:

- Enable WSL on your Windows system
- Install the latest WSL 2 version
- Download Ubuntu Linux by default

Once installation completes, restart your computer.
After reboot, you can launch Ubuntu from the Start Menu and continue with the commands below.

You can skip the WSL installation and proceed directly.
The commands in this file are ready to set up your private AI environment on any modern Linux distribution.


Follow the commands below carefully, they will:
- Install necessary dependencies
- Set up your local AI environment
- Prepare your system to run AI models privately
