## 💡 Why run your own AI locally?

- **🔒 Keep all data private** on your own machine.  
- **🧪 Learn and experiment safely** with AI.

## 🪟 For Windows Users

We recommend installing the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.  
WSL lets you run a full Linux environment directly on Windows — perfect for AI projects.  

**Open the Command Prompt (cmd) as an Administrator and run:**



    wsl --install


This will:  

- Enable WSL on your Windows system.  
- Install the latest WSL 2 version.

Once installation completes, **restart your computer**.  
After reboot, you can check available Linux distributions by opening the Command Prompt (cmd) and running:


    wsl --list --online


This will display a list of valid Linux distributions you can install with WSL.
